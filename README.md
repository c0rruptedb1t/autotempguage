# autotempguage

This script was made to create a time refresher for lm-sensors to keep an updated info on sensors

if this doesnt work try running installer.py

or if that doesnt work do it the manual way:
>'sudo apt-get install lm-sensors -y' 

then type 

>sudo sensors-detect 

and say yes to everything

_This is meant to be run in python3 in a Linux OS_
