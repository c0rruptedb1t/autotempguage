This script was made to create a time refresher for lm-sensors to keep an updated info on sensors

if this doesnt work try running installer.py
or if that doesnt work do it the manual way:
try open your terminal and type
'sudo apt-get install lm-sensors -y' 
then type 
'sudo sensors-detect' 
and say yes to everything

This is meant to be run in python3 in a Linux OS
